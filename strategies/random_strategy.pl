/* Need a generic rounding predicate. 

- Number is the real number you want to round.
- DecimalPlaces is the number of decimal places you want to round to.
- RoundingFunction can be 'ceil' or 'floor'.

Like rounding up in XL - here we use ceil(ing) as the name of the fn to call.
?- round_to_decimal_places(2.345, 2, ceil, Result).
Result = 2.35.

Like rounding down in XL - here we use floor as the name of the fn to call.
?- round_to_decimal_places(2.345, 2, floor, Result).
Result = 2.34.

    Multiplier is 10^DecimalPlaces,            % Multiplier for the specified decimal places
    call(RoundingFunction, Number * Multiplier, Temp), % Apply the rounding function (ceil or floor)
    RoundedNumber is Temp / Multiplier.        % Divide to get the result
